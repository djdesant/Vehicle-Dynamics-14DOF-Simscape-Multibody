% 
% This repository contains models and code to help engineers model and
% simulate vehicles driving on surfaces with varying conditions, including
% uneven, and have varying coefficients of friction.
%
% *Example Models*
% 
% # *<matlab:web('sm_vehicle_2axle_heave_roll.html') Standard vehicle dynamics tests>* such as slalom, step steer, parking, on flat and uneven surfaces.
% # *<matlab:web('sm_vehicle_2axle_heave_roll_grid.html') Vehicle dynamics on uneven terrain>* defined by a regular or non-uniform grid in MATLAB.
% # *<matlab:web('sm_vehicle_2axle_heave_roll_mu.html') Refine brake hardware and anti-lock braking algorithms>* on surface with adjustable icy patches.
